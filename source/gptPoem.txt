The river runs endlessly across the valley, carrying whispers of forgotten voices and dreams that were never allowed to rest.  
Beneath the shadow of tall mountains, the wind folds itself into silver ribbons, unraveling mysteries that no one has yet dared to name.  
The night sky spreads wide like an ocean of quiet fire, where distant stars burn with secrets too ancient for human tongues to capture.  
And yet, within the stillness of this boundless world, a single thought can grow into a forest, reaching higher than even the tallest tree.
